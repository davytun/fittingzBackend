## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

### Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later recommended)
*   [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)
*   [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

### Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/davytun/fittingz-backend.git
    cd fittingz-backend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the necessary environment variables. You can use the `.env.example` file as a template if one is available. Key variables include:
    *   `DATABASE_URL`: Connection string for your PostgreSQL database.
    *   `JWT_SECRET`: Secret key for signing JWTs.
    *   `PORT`: Port for the server to run on (e.g., 5000).
    *   `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGIN`: The frontend URL for CORS.
    *   Cloudinary credentials (`CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`, `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`, `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`).
    *   Email service credentials.

4.  **Set up the database:**
    Run the following commands to apply database migrations and seed initial data:
    ```bash
    pnpm prisma:migrate:dev
    pnpm prisma:seed
    ```

## Usage

To run the application in development mode with live-reloading:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

To run the application in production mode:

```bash
pnpm start
```

The server will start on the port specified in your `.env` file (defaulting to 5000).

## API Documentation

The API is documented using Swagger. Once the server is running, you can access the interactive API documentation at `http://localhost:5000/api-docs` (or your configured base URL).

## Authentication Features

The API includes a complete authentication system with the following features:

### Email Verification
*   6-digit verification codes sent via email
*   15-minute code expiration
*   Resend verification option

### Password Reset (Forgot Password)
*   Secure password reset flow with 6-digit codes
*   Email-based verification
*   Strong password requirements
*   Rate limiting to prevent abuse

For detailed documentation on the forgot password feature, see:
*   **[Forgot Password Guide](FORGOT_PASSWORD_GUIDE.md)** - Complete implementation guide
*   **[Forgot Password Summary](FORGOT_PASSWORD_SUMMARY.md)** - Quick reference

### Authentication Endpoints
*   `POST /api/auth/register` - Register new admin
*   `POST /api/auth/login` - Admin login
*   `POST /api/auth/verify-email` - Verify email with code
*   `POST /api/auth/resend-verification` - Resend verification code
*   `POST /api/auth/forgot-password` - Request password reset
*   `POST /api/auth/verify-reset-code` - Verify reset code
*   `POST /api/auth/reset-password` - Reset password
